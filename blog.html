    <h2>My experience drawing from a live subject</h2>

    <p>I've had experience drawing people before, and in the case of still images
        I think I've captured a strong likeness plenty of times, but this independent project really challenged me.</p>
    <p>Before the start of this class, I had very limited experience working from life. After the
         first in-class session, I was feeling rusty, but still confident that I could bounce back 
         from the break I had taken since the fall semester. The first drawing I had done wasn't 
         very good, but it seemed to me like there was a noticable likeness. In my opinion, the best
         reason to practice from life is to get a much stronger intuition for proportion and accurate
         drawing. While life provides a wider dynamic range for color and value, I don't think there
         is nearly as much of a difference between working from a photo and life when it comes to value
         as there is when it comes to drawing. I'm starting to realize that working from a flat, 
        fixed photo is about ten times easier than working from life, even with a very good model, 
        and for me personally, working with female subjects is much more difficult. I think that in most of the situations
        where a line is misplaced or there is an innacuracy in a drawing, the overall effect will be more masculine than feminine.
        For some reason exaggerated and wrong shapes don't look as strange on drawings of men. With smoother, rounder
         faces, the details require more subtlety, and the drawing will flip between looking like the subject and looking nothing like them 
         with even a slight change. I think that the only reason our first in-class session turned out as well as it did is because I was working from head-on.
         The session we did afterwards ended up sharing almost no resemblance and was a pretty frustrating process for me.</p>
    <p>The subject I used for my time was my independent work was my sister, which provided me with an opportunity to redeem myself 
        for how my previous session had gone. This independent session was also very frustrating for me. I had a tough time 
        figuring out how to approach it. She has a pretty simple and round head, which for me meant I had to be extremely careful to avoid 
        making her look old, which happened many times. Because I am used to working with adult male head proportions, I made quite a few 
        fundamental errors going in, including making her irises too small, and the space from the bottom of her nose to her chin too long.
        By the end of the first 1.5 hour segment, I decided to restart the drawing completely, which ended up being the right decision.
        With these drawings, I really don't care at all about detail or value outside of providing the basic clarity necessary to produce a likeness.
        Given my limited time-frame, I have really been trying to focus on the part where I need the most improvement, which is getting an accurate looking drawing.
        By the end of our session, I was much happier with the finished result, and thought that it did look a little like her, but it took around two hours of 
        studio time to get the drawing to a place where I actually thought it looked like the subject, even if it doesn't necessarily match the photo.
        Overall, I am glad I put myself through this, even though it was much more frustrating and even exhausting than I even would have expected it to be.
        It is very frustrating for me to know that what I'm doing is bad but feeling unable to fix it. And giving myself a fresh start halfway through really helped me to recalibrate and build a better foundation for myself.
        Even then, I still ended up erasing and reworking constantly in small incriments until I had something I was starting to like, which always produces a very thoughtless look to my work that lacks clarity. I 
        think that my work would be much more appealing if I could get the likeness and proportions right from the offset. 
        I do feel my work becoming more intentional the more I do, since I'm beginning to get a better idea of how to approach certain elements and in what order. 
        The final result to me isn't really a success since I didn't achieve a solid drawing until afterwards when I was working from a photo, which is something that I am already comfortable doing.
        Ideally, I'd like to be able to get a likeness during the live process. Still, I think I actually did learn from the experience and am looking forward to seeing whether or not I do better on the next project.</p>
